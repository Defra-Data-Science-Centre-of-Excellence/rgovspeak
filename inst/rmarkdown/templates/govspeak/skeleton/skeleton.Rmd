## What is this page?

This is a html preview of a govspeak markdown document. It is designed to show how your document will look when published on gov.uk.
Note that the contents list shows all headings for easier navigation when previewing. When published only top level numbered headings will
be shown.

Below is the govespeak user guide detailing all tags that can be used and how they will look when published.

## What is govspeak?

Govspeak is a simplified 'markup' language based on [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). It's designed to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as possible, using simple punctuation instead of complicated tags and code.

Govspeak was developed by the [Government Digital Service](digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk) with some extra features that we use to format 
content on [GOV.UK.](https://www.gov.uk)

## Working tags

## Bold text

    **Double asterisks around text** will turn it bold. Use it sparingly.

This is what it looks like:

**Double asterisks around text** will turn it bold. Use it sparingly.

## Headings

You can create heading levels using the hash character (#). The number of hashes shows the heading level.

The top-level headings on a page are automatically formatted as H1, so you don't need to use this.

`## This is an H2 subheading example`

`### This is an H3 subheading example`
    
This is what they look like:

## This is an H2 subheading example

### This is an H3 subheading example

Don't skip heading levels - in other words, don't jump straight to an H3. Don't insert an H1 anywhere.

## Links

### Internal links

Use the end of the URL path (so https://www.gov.uk/tax-disc would be /tax-disc). The link text goes in square brackets, and the slug goes in standard brackets, with no spaces in between:

    [Renew your tax disc](/tax-disc).

This looks like:

[Renew your tax disc](/tax-disc).

### External links

For external links, you need to include the full URL with http:// or www:

    [UK Parliament](http://www.parliament.uk).

This looks like:

[UK Parliament](http://www.parliament.uk).

### Email links

    <address@example.com>

This looks like:

<address@example.com>

## Tables

Create tables in rmarkdown using the kable() function. This is a simple table generator.
This is what that table looks like on GOV.UK:
```{r echo=TRUE}
kable(head(iris))
```

## Plots

Plot image files will be created at 960 x 640 @ 72 dpi. Images will be saved in a folder called "images" within the document folder.

Image filenames are created by the code chunk title that generates the image, eg, `{r title}`

The following code chunk creates three images that display the same data in different formats. The three image files produced within this single chunk will be named:

* 1-abc-1.png
* 1-abc-2.png
* 1-abc-3.png


    `{r 1-abc}
      df <- data.frame(x = rep(2011:2016, each = 3),
                 y = sample(1:4, 18, replace = TRUE),
                 colour = rep(LETTERS[1:3], 6))
      ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
        geom_col(position = "dodge",
                 aes(fill = colour))
      ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
        geom_col(position = "stack",
                 aes(fill = colour))
      ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
        geom_col(position = "fill",
                    aes(fill = colour))
    `
    
    
```{r 1-abc}
df <- data.frame(x = rep(2011:2016, each = 3),
                 y = sample(1:4, 18, replace = TRUE),
                 colour = rep(LETTERS[1:3], 6))
ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
        geom_col(position = "dodge",
                 aes(fill = colour))
ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
        geom_col(position = "stack",
                 aes(fill = colour))
ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
        geom_col(position = "fill",
                 aes(fill = colour))
```

Please title your code chunks using an increasing number sequence as the first part of the title. The subsequent string should have a meaningful name for the image. For example:

* 1-mortality_statistics
* 2-AMR_statistics
* 3-AMR_by_sex

## Bulleted lists

### Unordered lists

Create bulleted lists using asterisks at the start of each line:

`* asterisk 1`

`* asterisk 2`

`* asterisk 3`

This is what they look like:

* asterisk 1
* asterisk 2
* asterisk 3

### Ordered lists (steps)

We only use numbered lists for describing steps as part of a process. Do this by adding:

`s1. Add numbers.`  
`s2. Check numbers.`  
`s3. Love numbers.`

This example follows the [style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#steps) and looks like:

s1. Add numbers.
s2. Check numbers.
s3. Love numbers.


Steps need an extra line break after the final step (in other words, 2 full blank lines). If you don't do this, other markdown directly after them won't work. If you have a subheading after numbered steps, add a line break after this.

## Callouts

To draw attention to content, you can use callouts. For example, you can put some text in an 'information callout' to indicate that it's something related that's worth knowing, or doesn't fit the flow of the content.  
Only use the more severe 'warning callout' to indicate serious consequences, such as a fine or criminal proceedings.

### Information callouts

    ^This is useful information that's worth knowing.^

This looks like:

^This is useful information that's worth knowing.^

### Warning callouts

    %You will be fined or put in prison if you don't do this thing.%

This looks like:

%You will be fined or put in prison if you don't do this thing.%

### Example callout

    $E
    **Example** 
    Open the pod bay doors.
    $E

This looks like:

$E
**Example** 
Open the pod bay doors.
$E

### Call to action

    $CTA
    **caution**
    Pay attention.
    $CTA
    
This looks like:

$CTA
**Caution**
Pay attention.
$CTA

With longer text it looks like this:

$CTA
**Caution**  
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Praesent ullamcorper, nunc nec lobortis semper, ante risus tincidunt nulla, et 
mollis augue nisi eu lacus. Vestibulum porta augue vel nunc suscipit dictum. Ut volutpat aliquet dolor et tincidunt.
$CTA

## Addresses
```
    $A
    HM Revenue and Customs
    Bradford
    BD98 1YY
    $A
```

This creates an address box, which looks like this:

$A
HM Revenue and Customs
Bradford
BD98 1YY
$A

Do not use bold for the address title. This is not accessible because it looks like a heading and can be confusing for users of assistive technology. Use heading Markdown above the address Markdown instead if you need to draw attention to the information.

## Contacts

    $C
    Financial Conduct Authority
    <consumer.queries@fca.org.uk>
    Telephone: 0800 111 6768
    Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
    Saturday, 9am to 1pm
    [Find out about call charges](/call-charges)
    $C

Remember to add a call charges link when there are telephone numbers.

This creates a contact box, which looks like this:

$C
Financial Conduct Authority  
<consumer.queries@fca.org.uk>  
Telephone: 0800 111 6768  
Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm  
Saturday, 9am to 1pm  
[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)  
$C

Do not use bold for the contact team name. This is not accessible because it looks like a heading and can be confusing for users of assistive technology. Use heading Markdown above the contact Markdown instead if you need to draw attention to the information.

### Download links

Use '$D' to place download links in a box that shows users they're going to download a file. Always include the file type and size in brackets as part of the link text and title.

    $D
    [Download 'Jobcentre Plus form for employment' (PDF, 43KB)](http://example.com/example.pdf)
    $D

This is what download links look like:

$D
[Download 'Jobcentre Plus form for employment' (PDF, 43KB)]()
$D

When linking to PDFs, don't put the trailing slash '/' at the end, as the link won't work.

This is only used for external download files. If the file is hosted on Whitehall, it should link to the splash page as an internal link.

## Buttons

### Default button

    {button}[Continue](https://gov.uk/random){/button}

which looks like this:

{button}[Continue](https://gov.uk/random){/button}


### Start now button

To turn a button into a ['Start now' button](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/start-pages#start-page-elements), you can add `start` to the button tag.  
These buttons should only appear once per page, and be used at the start of a transaction.

    {button start}[Start now](https://gov.uk/random){/button}

which looks like this:

{button start}[Start now](https://gov.uk/random){/button}


### Cross domain tracking button

You can add a Google Analytics [tracking id](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7372977?hl=en) which will send page views to another domain, this is used to help services understand the start of their users journeys.

    {button start cross-domain-tracking:UA-XXXXXX-Y}
        [Start now](https://example.com/external-service/start-now)
    {/button}

which looks like this:

{button start cross-domain-tracking:UA-XXXXXX-Y}
  [Start now](https://example.com/external-service/start-now)
{/button}

## Non working tags

## Acronyms

List these in the following format at the end of the document and all occurrences will be marked up as acronyms:

```
*[FCO]: Foreign and Commonwealth Office
```

This means the full text will appear when users hover over the acronym wherever it occurs on the page.

### Example of acronym use

Example: PCSO and PCSOs are both in a piece of content.

Always put the longer one first in the list - otherwise PCSOs will pick up only the singular 'Police Community Support Officer'.

```
*[PCSOs]: Police Community Support Officers  
*[PCSO]: Police Community Support Officer
```   

This is how it works, mouse over the acronyms.
<p>Example: <abbr title="Police Community Support Officer">PCSO</abbr> and <abbr title="Police Community Support Officers">PCSOs</abbr> are both in a piece of content.</p>

### Unordered lists

## Bulleted lists

Hyphens or plus signs at the start of each line are not implemented. Use * instead.

```
- a hyphen
- another hyphen

+ plus signs
+ more plus signs
```
