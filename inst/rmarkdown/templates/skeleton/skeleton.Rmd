## Markdown 

### Using Markdown to format content on GOV.UK.

The markdown listed here is the markdown that is supported by the rgovspeak packages html preview. 
For a full list of markdown you can use on GOV.UK see the 
[GOV.UK Markdown guide](https://govspeak-preview.publishing.service.gov.uk/guide).

If you want to check that any govspeak markdown will be supported you can use the 
[Govspeak converter](https://govspeak-preview.publishing.service.gov.uk/).

## Addresses
For addresses use the Markdown $A above and below the address text. For example:

```
    $A
    HM Revenue and Customs
    Bradford
    BD98 1YY
    $A
```

This creates an address box, which looks like this:

$A
HM Revenue and Customs
Bradford
BD98 1YY
$A

Do not use bold for the address title. This is not accessible because it looks like a heading and 
can be confusing for users of assistive technology.

## Bullets

To create a bulleted list:

use asterisks (*) to make bullets (hyphens also work) for example:
  
`* asterisk 1`

`- hyphen 2`

Looks like this:

* asterisk 1
- hyphen 2

Indent by 2 spaces to create sub lists. For example:

```
* asterisk 1
  * asterisk 2
```

Looks like this:

* asterisk 1
  * asterisk 2
    
make sure there is one space after the asterisk and leave 1 empty line space before the bullets 
start, and one after.

See the style guide to check [how to punctuate bullets.](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#bullet-points-steps)

## Buttons

### Default button

To use a button the Markdown `{button}` followed by the button text in [], then the link in ().
Close the button markdown by adding `{/button}` at the end.

    {button}[Continue](https://gov.uk/random){/button}

which looks like this:

{button}[Continue](https://gov.uk/random){/button}


### Start now button

To turn a button into a ['Start now' button](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/start-pages#start-page-elements), 
you can add `start` to the button tag. These buttons should only appear once per page, and be used 
at the start of a transaction.

    {button start}[Start now](https://gov.uk/random){/button}

which looks like this:

{button start}[Start now](https://gov.uk/random){/button}


### Cross domain tracking button

You can add a Google Analytics [tracking id](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7372977?hl=en)
which will send page views to another domain, this is used to help services understand the start of 
their users journeys.

    {button start cross-domain-tracking:UA-XXXXXX-Y}
        [Start now](https://example.com/external-service/start-now)
    {/button}

which looks like this:

{button start cross-domain-tracking:UA-XXXXXX-Y}
  [Start now](https://example.com/external-service/start-now)
{/button}

## Callouts

To draw attention to content, you can use callouts. For example, you can put some text in an 
'information callout' to indicate that it's something related that's worth knowing, or doesn't fit
the flow of the content. 

Only use the more severe 'warning callout' to indicate serious consequences, such as a fine or 
criminal proceedings.

### Information callouts

For information callouts, put `^` before and after the text you want to appear in the box.

    ^This is useful information that's worth knowing.^

This looks like:

^This is useful information that's worth knowing.^

### Warning callouts

For information callouts, put `%` before and after the text you want to appear in the box.

    %You will be fined or put in prison if you don't do this thing.%

This looks like:

%You will be fined or put in prison if you don't do this thing.%

### Example callout

To create the example callout box use the Markdown $E above and below the link.

```
$E
**Example** 
Open the pod bay doors.
$E
```

This looks like:

$E
**Example** 
Open the pod bay doors.
$E

### Call to action

Call to action Markdown should be used for short links to actions, like applying for a licence. It 
creates a tinted box which highlights the task.

To create the call to action box use the Markdown $CTA above and below the link.

```
$CTA
  Some action
$CTA
```
    
This looks like:

$CTA
  Some action
$CTA

## Charts

Charts Markdown allows you to create 'simple', 'stacked' and 'compact' bar charts that can also 
display negative values. You can combine these different types of chart within one chart.

Markdown lets the user switch between a bar chart and a table view on the webpage.

To create a chart, use the same Markdown as for a table, with an additional piece of charts Markdown
on a line below the table.

See the section on Tables for how to make tables in Markdown.

### Simple barchart

Add {barchart} at the end of a numeric table to display a simple bar chart. Multiple columns will 
display as grouped bars.

|Shop   |	Apples|
|:------|------:|
|Shop 1	|      6|
|Shop 2	|      6|
|Shop 3	|     18|
{barchart}

#### Clustered barchart

|Shop	  | Apples| Bananas| Plums|
|:------|-------|--------|-----:|
|Shop 1	|      6|	      6|    10|
|Shop 2	|      6|	      8|    10|
|Shop 3	|     18|	      2|    10|
|Shop 4	|      5|	      4|    10|
|Shop 5	|      7|	      7|    10|
|Shop 6	|     11|	      1|    10|
{barchart}


### Stacked barchart

Use {barchart stacked} for stacked bars. The final column is used to display the total.

|Shop	  | 20 to 30|	31 to 40|	41 to 50|	51 and over|	Total|
|:------|---------|---------|---------|------------|------:|
|Shop 1 |	      20|      	35|      	30|          15|	  100|
|Shop 2	|        6|	      54|	      25|	         15|	  100|
|Shop 3	|       60|	      22|	      10|	          8|	  100|
{barchart stacked} 

### Negative barchart

If you have negative data values you must use {barchart negative} to display the chart correctly.

|Category           | Contribution (percentage points)|
|:------------------|--------------------------------:|
|Potatoes           |                              1.6|
|Poultry            |                              1.3|
|Eggs               |                              1.1|
|Pigs               |                              0.7|
|Cattle and calves  |                              0.6|
|Fresh fruit        |                              0.3|
|Sheep and lambs    |                              0.2|
|Fresh vegetables   |                              0.2|
|Forage plants      |                              0.0|
|Sugar beet         |                              0.0|
|Plants and flowers |                             -0.0|
|Oats               |                             -0.1|
|Oilseed rape       |                             -0.9|
|Barley             |                             -1.5|
|Wheat              |                             -2.7|
|Milk               |                             -6.4|
{barchart negative}

### Compact barchart

If you want a compact version of a chart add compact to the barchart tag, 
e.g. {barchart stacked compact}

|Shop	  | 20 to 30|	31 to 40|	41 to 50|	51 and over|	Total|
|:------|---------|---------|---------|------------|------:|
|Shop 1 |	      20|      	35|      	30|          15|	  100|
|Shop 2	|        6|	      54|	      25|	         15|	  100|
|Shop 3	|       60|	      22|	      10|	          8|	  100|
{barchart stacked compact} 

### Colours in charts

You can use up to 6 colours to represent different categories when you create a chart.
The colours and the order they appear cannot be changed.

This is so they're accessible for users who are colour blind or have low vision.

Find out about [using colours for data visualisation](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/data-visualisation-colours-in-charts/)
on the Government Analysis Function website.

Read [colour contrast requirements under the WCAG2.1 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html).

## Contacts

To create the contact box use the Markdown $C above and below the text.

```
$C
Financial Conduct Authority
<consumer.queries@fca.org.uk>
Telephone: 0800 111 6768
Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
Saturday, 9am to 1pm
[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)
$C
```

Remember to add a call charges link when there are telephone numbers.

This creates a contact box, which looks like this:

$C
Financial Conduct Authority  
<consumer.queries@fca.org.uk>  
Telephone: 0800 111 6768  
Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm  
Saturday, 9am to 1pm  
[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)  
$C

Do not use bold for the contact team name. This is not accessible because it looks like a heading 
and can be confusing for users of assistive technology. Use heading Markdown above the contact 
Markdown instead if you need to draw attention to the information.

### Download links

Use '$D' to place download links in a box that shows users they're going to download a file. Always 
include the file type and size in brackets as part of the link text and title.

```
$D
[Download 'Jobcentre Plus form for employment' (PDF, 43KB)](http://example.com/example.pdf)
$D
```

This is what download links look like:

$D
[Download 'Jobcentre Plus form for employment' (PDF, 43KB)]()
$D

When linking to PDFs, don't put the trailing slash '/' at the end, as the link won't work.

This is only used for external download files. If the file is hosted on Whitehall, it should link to
the splash page as an internal link.

## Headings

In the document body, use 2 hashtags (##) for a section heading and 3 or 4 hashtags for sub-headings. 
These are called H2s, H3s and H4s. 

Make sure you use heading level Markdown (the hashtags) rather than bold text - assistive technology
lets users navigate to heading levels.

Use the headings in sequence. An H3 needs to be preceded by an H2 and an H4 needs an H3.

Do not use one hashtag, or you will get a title heading in the middle of your document.

There's no need to use Markdown in the title and summary boxes. They are styled automatically.

For example:

`## This is an H2 subheading example`

`### This is an H3 subheading example`

`#### This is an H4 subheading example`
    
This is what they look like:

## This is an H2 subheading example

### This is an H3 subheading example

#### This is an H4 subheading example

There's more [guidance on headings in the content design manual.](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk#structuring-content)

## Images

Where possible the auto chart markdown should be used. This section is for charts uploaded as image 
files.

The rgovspeak package requires that each chart or image created in R is produced by a single code 
chunk. This is because the chunk name is used to identify the image in the document and allows the 
correct markup to be added to the MD file.

The chunk name should be of the format 

[notice name]-figure-[chart number]

for example api-figure-4.

Example image:

```{r rgovspeak-guide-figure-1, echo=TRUE}
df <- data.frame(x = rep(2011:2016, each = 3),
                 y = sample(1:4, 18, replace = TRUE),
                 colour = rep(LETTERS[1:3], 6))

ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
        geom_col(position = "dodge",
                 aes(fill = colour))
```

Plot image files will by default be svg's created at 960 x 640 @ 72 dpi.

You can change the image type, size and the dpi by updating the govspeak options in the header YAML 
chunk.

For example:

<pre>
---
title: "rgovspeak guide"
date: "`r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B %Y')`"
output: 
  rgovspeak2::govspeak:
    image_type: "png"
    fig.height: 4
    fig.width: 6
    dpi: 92
---
</pre>

If you want to output multiple image types you can use

` image_type: ['png', 'jpeg', 'pdf', 'svg', 'tiff']`

Only the first format is used in the output document, but the images corresponding to the rest of 
the formats are also generated.

If your text or elements are too small in your chart it will be easier to increase the size of the 
element in your plot call.

### ggfbs

To aid in producing compliant charts the ggfbs package has been created. 
ggfbs is a package containing convenient functions to create publication ready charts with Defra's 
Farm Business Survey (FBS) style. This package was built with and designed to work in conjunction 
with ggplot2 and provides a set of templates to create basic chart whilst also allowing a deep level
of customisation.

```{r rgovspeak-guide-figure-2, echo = FALSE}
if (requireNamespace("ggfbs", quietly = TRUE)) {
  # Load libraries
  library(dplyr)
  library(ggplot2)
  library(ggfbs)

  # Read in some data
  fbi_data <- read.csv(
    "https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1031993/fbs-farmbusinessincome-series_9nov21.csv"
  )

  # Manipulate dataset
  plot_data <- fbi_data %>% 
    filter(variable == "Farm Business Income", fbsyear %in% c("2019/20", "2020/21"))
    
  # Create basic grouped bar plot
  plot_data %>% 
    fbs_barplot(aes(x = factor_name, y = mean, fill = fbsyear))
} else {
  print("Install ggfbs to see this plot")
}
```

You can find out more on the [ggfbs github page](https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/ggfbs).

## Links

To add internal links to GOV.UK pages, use square brackets [] around the link text and round 
brackets () around the link URL. Make sure there are no spaces between the brackets or the link will not work.

For example:

`[GOV.UK style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide)`

Looks like this:

[GOV.UK style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide)

### Email links
Use 'less than' (<) and 'greater than' (>) arrows around email addresses to make them a link.

For example: 

`<example@example.com>`

Looks like this:

example@example.com

### Linking to sections on a page

You can use Markdown to link to particular section headings on a page - also known as an 'anchor link
- but it creates accessibility issues so you should avoid it if possible.

Read the guidance on using links in content before you use an anchor link.

If you cannot avoid using an anchor link, format the link by adding # and the heading name, with all
words separated by hyphens, to the page url. 

For example, to link to the section 'Capacity management', 
use https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-services-network-psn-service-management-good-practice/service-management-good-practice#capacity-management.

## Numbered list

Use numbers followed by a full stop, for example: 

`1. A`

`2. B`

looks like this:

1. A
2. B

Make sure there is one space after the full stop.

You need 1 empty line space before the numbers start, and 1 at the end.

Sub-items need an indent of 2 spaces.

See the [style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style) to check how 
to punctuate numbered lists.

## Subscript and superscript

For subscript, put `<sub>` before the word you want to appear in subscript, and `</sub>` afterwards.

For example:

`some text<sub>subscript</sub>`

looks like this:

some text<sub>subscript</sub>



For superscript, put `<sup>` before the word you want to appear in superscript, and `</sup>` 
afterwards.

For example:

`some text<sup>superscript</sup>`

looks like this:

some text<sup>superscript</sup> 

You should use subscript and superscript for scientific notation and measurements, for example 
chemical names, metres squared etc.

## Tables

Create tables in rmarkdown using the kable() function. This is a simple table generator.
This is what that table looks like on GOV.UK:
```{r echo=TRUE}
kable(head(iris))
```
