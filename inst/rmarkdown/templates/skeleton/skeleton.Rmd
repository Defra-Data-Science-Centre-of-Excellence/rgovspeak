## 1. Introduction to GOV.UK Markdown

### 1.1 Supported Markdown Syntax

This guide outlines the markdown supported by the \`rgovspeak\` package's HTML preview.

- Full documentation: [GOV.UK Markdown guide](https://govspeak-preview.publishing.service.gov.uk/guide)
- Test your Markdown: [Govspeak converter](https://govspeak-preview.publishing.service.gov.uk/)

## 2. Text Formatting

### 2.1 Headings

Use heading-level markdown (`##`, `###`, `####`) to create H2, H3, H4 headings. Do **not** use bold text for headings.

Examples:

`## This is an H2 subheading example`

`### This is an H3 subheading example`

`#### This is an H4 subheading example`
    
This is what they look like:

## This is an H2 subheading example

### This is an H3 subheading example

#### This is an H4 subheading example


More guidance: [Content design manual](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk#structuring-content)

### 2.2 Subscript and Superscript

- Subscript: `text<sub>sub</sub>` → text<sub>sub</sub>
- Superscript: `text<sup>super</sup>` → text<sup>super</sup>

Use for chemical formulas, units, etc.

## 3. Lists

### 3.1 Bulleted (Unordered) Lists

Use `*`, `-`, or `+` with 2-space indents for sub-items.

```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2
  - Subitem
```

* Item 1
* Item 2
  - Subitem

Punctuation guidance: [GOV.UK Style Guide - Bullet Points](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#bullet-points-steps)

### 3.2 Numbered Lists for Steps

Use for sequential steps only:

```
s1. Add numbers.
s2. Check numbers.
s3. Love numbers.
```

s1. Add numbers.
s2. Check numbers.
s3. Love numbers.

Leave 2 blank lines after the final step.

### 3.3 Standard Numbered Lists

```markdown
1. First
2. Second
```

1. First
2. Second

Indent sub-items by 2 spaces.

## 4. Links

### 4.1 Download Links

Use '$D' to place download links in a box that shows users they're going to download a file. Always 
include the file type and size in brackets as part of the link text and title.

```
$D
[Download 'Jobcentre Plus form for employment' (PDF, 43KB)](http://example.com/example.pdf)
$D
```

This is what download links look like:

$D
[Download 'Jobcentre Plus form for employment' (PDF, 43KB)]()
$D

When linking to PDFs, don't put the trailing slash '/' at the end, as the link won't work.

This is only used for external download files. If the file is hosted on Whitehall, it should link to
the splash page as an internal link.

### 4.2 Email Links

Use 'less than' (<) and 'greater than' (>) arrows around email addresses to make them a link.

For example: 

`<example@example.com>`

Looks like this:

example@example.com

### 4.3 Section Anchor Links (Avoid)

Avoid using in-page `#anchor` links unless absolutely necessary, as they raise accessibility concerns.

## 5. Special Block Elements

### 5.1 Addresses

Wrap in `$A`:

```
$A
HM Revenue and Customs
Bradford
BD98 1YY
$A
```
This creates an address box, which looks like this:

$A
HM Revenue and Customs
Bradford
BD98 1YY
$A

### 5.2 Contact Boxes
Wrap in `$C`. Always include a call charges link if a phone number is present.

```
$C
Financial Conduct Authority
<consumer.queries@fca.org.uk>
Telephone: 0800 111 6768
Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
Saturday, 9am to 1pm
[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)
$C
```

This creates a contact box, which looks like this:

$C
Financial Conduct Authority  
<consumer.queries@fca.org.uk>  
Telephone: 0800 111 6768  
Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm  
Saturday, 9am to 1pm  
[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)  
$C

## 6. Callouts

### 6.1 Information

Use `^` markers:

    ^This is useful information that's worth knowing.^

This looks like:

^This is useful information that's worth knowing.^

### 6.2 Warnings

Use `%` markers:

    %You will be fined or put in prison if you don't do this thing.%

This looks like:

%You will be fined or put in prison if you don't do this thing.%

### 6.3 Example Boxes

Wrap in `$E`:

```
$E
**Example** 
Open the pod bay doors.
$E
```

This looks like:

$E
**Example** 
Open the pod bay doors.
$E

### 6.4 Call to Action

Wrap in `$CTA`:

```
$CTA
  Some action
$CTA
```
    
This looks like:

$CTA
  Some action
$CTA

## 7. Buttons

### 7.1 Standard Button

To use a button add

```
    {button}[Continue](https://gov.uk/random){/button}
```

which looks like this:

{button}[Continue](https://gov.uk/random){/button}


### 7.2 "Start Now" Button

To use a start button

```
    {button start}[Start now](https://gov.uk/random){/button}
```

which looks like this:

{button start}[Start now](https://gov.uk/random){/button}

Only one per page. Use at start of transaction.

### 7.3 Cross-Domain Tracking Button

You can add a Google Analytics [tracking id](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7372977?hl=en)
which will send page views to another domain, this is used to help services understand the start of 
their users journeys.

```
    {button start cross-domain-tracking:UA-XXXXXX-Y}
        [Start now](https://example.com/external-service/start-now)
    {/button}
```

which looks like this:

{button start cross-domain-tracking:UA-XXXXXX-Y}
  [Start now](https://example.com/external-service/start-now)
{/button}

## 8. Tables

### 8.1 Creating Tables

Use `kable()` from the `knitr` package.

```{r rgovspeak-guide-table-1, echo=TRUE}
kable(head(iris))
```

## 9 Charts

### 9.1 Simple barchart

Add {barchart} at the end of a numeric table to display a simple bar chart. Multiple columns will 
display as grouped bars.

|Shop   |	Apples|
|:------|------:|
|Shop 1	|      6|
|Shop 2	|      6|
|Shop 3	|     18|
{barchart}

### 9.2 Clustered barchart

|Shop	  | Apples| Bananas| Plums|
|:------|-------|--------|-----:|
|Shop 1	|      6|	      6|    10|
|Shop 2	|      6|	      8|    10|
|Shop 3	|     18|	      2|    10|
|Shop 4	|      5|	      4|    10|
|Shop 5	|      7|	      7|    10|
|Shop 6	|     11|	      1|    10|
{barchart}


### 9.3 Stacked barchart

Use {barchart stacked} for stacked bars. The final column is used to display the total.

|Shop	  | 20 to 30|	31 to 40|	41 to 50|	51 and over|	Total|
|:------|---------|---------|---------|------------|------:|
|Shop 1 |	      20|      	35|      	30|          15|	  100|
|Shop 2	|        6|	      54|	      25|	         15|	  100|
|Shop 3	|       60|	      22|	      10|	          8|	  100|
{barchart stacked} 

### 9.4 Negative barchart

If you have negative data values you must use {barchart negative} to display the chart correctly.

|Category           | Contribution (percentage points)|
|:------------------|--------------------------------:|
|Potatoes           |                              1.6|
|Poultry            |                              1.3|
|Eggs               |                              1.1|
|Pigs               |                              0.7|
|Cattle and calves  |                              0.6|
|Fresh fruit        |                              0.3|
|Sheep and lambs    |                              0.2|
|Fresh vegetables   |                              0.2|
|Forage plants      |                              0.0|
|Sugar beet         |                              0.0|
|Plants and flowers |                             -0.0|
|Oats               |                             -0.1|
|Oilseed rape       |                             -0.9|
|Barley             |                             -1.5|
|Wheat              |                             -2.7|
|Milk               |                             -6.4|
{barchart negative}

### 9.5 Compact barchart

If you want a compact version of a chart add compact to the barchart tag, 
e.g. {barchart stacked compact}

|Shop	  | 20 to 30|	31 to 40|	41 to 50|	51 and over|	Total|
|:------|---------|---------|---------|------------|------:|
|Shop 1 |	      20|      	35|      	30|          15|	  100|
|Shop 2	|        6|	      54|	      25|	         15|	  100|
|Shop 3	|       60|	      22|	      10|	          8|	  100|
{barchart stacked compact} 

### 9.6 Colours in charts

You can use up to 6 colours to represent different categories when you create a chart.
The colours and the order they appear cannot be changed.

This is so they're accessible for users who are colour blind or have low vision.

Find out about [using colours for data visualisation](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/data-visualisation-colours-in-charts/)
on the Government Analysis Function website.

Read [colour contrast requirements under the WCAG2.1 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html).

## 10. Images

### 10.1 Creating Images from Code

The rgovspeak package requires that each chart or image created in R is produced by a single code 
chunk. This is because the chunk name is used to identify the image in the document and allows the 
correct markup to be added to the MD file.

The chunk name should be of the format 

[notice name]-figure-[chart number]

for example api-figure-4.

Example image:

```{r rgovspeak-guide-figure-1, echo=TRUE}
df <- data.frame(
  x = rep(2011:2016, each = 3),
  y = sample(1:4, 18, replace = TRUE),
  colour = rep(LETTERS[1:3], 6)
)

ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge", aes(fill = colour)) +
  theme_af(legend = "bottom") +
  scale_fill_discrete_af()
```

Plot image files will by default be svg's created at 960 x 640 @ 72 dpi.

You can change the image type, size and the dpi by updating the govspeak options in the header YAML 
chunk.

For example:

<pre>
---
title: "rgovspeak guide"
date: "`r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B %Y')`"
output: 
  rgovspeak2::govspeak:
    image_type: "png"
    fig.height: 4
    fig.width: 6
    dpi: 92
---
</pre>

If you want to output multiple image types you can use

` image_type: ['png', 'jpeg', 'pdf', 'svg', 'tiff']`

Only the first format is used in the output document, but the images corresponding to the rest of 
the formats are also generated.

If your text or elements are too small in your chart it will be easier to increase the size of the 
element in your plot call.

Use the [afcharts](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/afcharts/index.html) package to maintain correct colour and formatting.
