This package adds govespeak markdown functionality to rmarkdown. It allows for a HTML preview of the document. It is designed to show how your document will look when 
published on gov.uk.

Note that the contents list shows all headings for easier navigation when previewing. When published only top level numbered headings will
be shown.

All govspeak tags are implemented except the acronym tag.

To use install the package in Rstudio. Then go file -> new-> Rmarkdown document. In the pop up window select from template and select the govespeak option. The govespeak user guide
will be opened and you can press knit to see a preview of the document.
